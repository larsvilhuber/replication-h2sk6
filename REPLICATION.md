# ["The Coming Divorce Decline""] Validation and Replication results

SUMMARY
-------
> INSTRUCTION: The Data Editor will fill this part out. It will be based on any [REQUIRED] and [SUGGESTED] action items that the report makes a note of. 

> INSTRUCTION: ALWAYS do "Data description", "Code description". If data is present, ALWAYS do "Data checks". If time is sufficient (initial assessment!), do "Replication steps", if not, explain why not.

Data description
----------------

### ICPSR data deposit
- openICPSR metadata is not applicable here

### American Community Survey
- The article uses women's responses to martial events questions in the ACS to evaluate trends in divorce over the past decade
- The data is publicly available and commonly known, but it is not cited in the manuscript. This should be cited.
- Data specifically used in this article can be accessed at: https://osf.io/yb4hr/

Data checks
-----------
> - can data be read (using software indicated by author)?
- I do not have a software that can read the data
> - Is data in archive-ready formats (CSV, TXT) or in custom formats (DTA, SAS7BDAT, Rdata)?
- Data is in .dat format
> - Does the data have variable labels (Stata: run `describe using (name of DTA)` and check that there is content in the column "variable label")?
- Variable labels cannot be checked
> - Run check for PII ([PII_stata_scan.do](PII_stata_scan.do), sourced from [here](https://github.com/J-PAL/stata_PII_scan) if using Stata) and report results. Note: this check will have lots of false positives - fields it thinks might be sensitive that are not, in fact, sensitive. Apply judgement.
- PII could not scan the .dat files


Code description
----------------

There are two provided stata files, one titled "decline.do" and another titled "coming divorce decline with newlyweds.do"

Replication steps
-----------------

1. Downloaded code and data from the socarxiv website
2. Added the config.do generating system information
3. Set the Stata working directory as requested and ran decline.do

Computing Environment
---------------------
> INSTRUCTIONS: This might be automated, for now, please fill in manually. Remove examples that are not relevant, adjust examples to fit special circumstances. Some of this is available from the standard log output in Stata. These can be found by right-clicking on "My PC" (for a PC), "About this Mac" (for a Mac), and a combination of "free -g" and "cat /proc/cpuinfo" on Linux.

- Mac Laptop, 8 GB of memory
- CISER Shared Windows Server 2016, 256GB, Intel Xeon E5-4669 v3 @ 2.10Ghz (3 processors)
- CISER Virtual Windows Server 2016, 16GB, Intel Haswell 2.19 Ghz (2 processors)
- BioHPC Linux server, Centos 7.6, 64 cores; 1024GB RAM; 

Findings
--------
> Describe your findings both positive and negative in some detail, for each **Figure, Table, and any in-text numbers**. You can re-use the Excel file created under *Code Description*. When errors happen, be as precise as possible. For differences in figures, provide both a screenshot of what the manuscript contains, as well as the figure produced by the code you ran.

### Tables
- Table 1: Looks the same
- Table 2: (contains no data)
- Table 3: Minor differences in row 5, column 3, 0.003 instead of 0.3

### Figures
> INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a comparison with the paper when describing that figures look different. Use a screenshot for the paper, and the graph generated by the programs for the comparison. 
- Figure 1: Looks the same
- Figure 2: no program provided
- Figure 3: Paper version looks different from the one generated by programs:

### In-Text Numbers
> INSTRUCTIONS: list page and line number of in-text numbers. If ambiguous, cite the surrounding text, i.e., "the rate fell to 52% of all jobs: verified".

[ ] There are no in-text numbers, or all in-text numbers stem from tables and figures.

[ ] There are in-text numbers, but they are not identified in the code

- Page 21, line 5: Same


Classification
--------------
> INSTRUCTIONS: Make an assessment here.
>
> Full replication can include a small number of apparently insignificant changes in the numbers in the table. Full replication also applies when changes to the programs needed to be made, but were successfully implemented.
>
> Partial replication means that a significant number (>25%) of programs and/or numbers are different.
>
> Note that if any data is confidential and not available, then a partial replication applies. This should be noted on the "Replication assessment questionnaire"/ JIRA.
>
> Note that when all data is confidential, it is unlikely that this exercise should have been attempted.
>
> Failure to replicate: only a small number of programs ran successfully, or only a small number of numbers were successfully generated (<25%)

- [ ] full replication
- [ ] full replication with minor issues
- [ ] partial replication (see above)
- [ ] not able to replicate most or all of the results (reasons see above)
